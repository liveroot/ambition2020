# this code implements Depth First Traversal in a graph. Each element in the graph's adjacency list
# represents a list of nodes directly connected to the current element. Each of these lists represent
# levels in the graph. We traverse all the nodes from root node to last node first, then we back-track
# to the last visited common node and then we take second branch from there, until we back-track to root node
# and no branches are left unvisited.
# --------------
# For traversal:
# --------------
# 1. We first push the root node in a stack and mark it visited.
# 2. Now we get the list of adjacent nodes from the root node and push all adjacent nodes in the list
#    to the stack.
# 3. As we are pushing the adjacent nodes to the stack, we mark them as visited.
# 4. Simultaneously, we pop the nodes from the stack and append the node's value to the result
# --------------
